# Mountain Rescue Incident Form (SurveyJS Demo)

This repository hosts a static site that demonstrates how SurveyJS can be used to collect
mountain rescue incident details. The project is ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the project with any static file server. The
survey lets you capture basic location and incident information and exports the responses as
JSON when the form is completed.

## Next steps

- Extend the survey schema with the fields required by your rescue workflow.
- Connect the complete handler to an API endpoint or keep the client-side download flow.
- Embed Leaflet or another mapping library to let users pick coordinates interactively.
